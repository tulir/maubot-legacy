# Maubot
A chatbot platform abstraction library. If you write a bot that uses Maubot interfaces,
you can easily allow it to connect to any chat platform with Maubot bindings.

Please note that Maubot is at an early stage with only basic support for a few platforms.

Install with `go get maunium.net/go/maubot`
